I helped develop multiple projects, from desktop ERP solutions to modern SPA and APIs using different technologies and platforms.

Worked in different environments, open space to the comfort of a quiet private office.

For the last year I&#39;ve been leading a development team while trying to balance hands on time and meetings.

During spare time you can find me outdoors or in  a lake training for the next long distance swim. Also trying to improve my writing and turn blogging into a habit.

**Freelancer**, thedev.ro, *2007 - 2012*

php, wordpress, javascript, html, css, git

During my spare time I made a habit of taking on various freelancing projects because I find this a good way to improve my communication, management and also developer skills.

I got the opportunity to work with multiple clients who gave me the chance to learn a lot.

I am glad I decided to experience freelancing and I recommend this to any developer that wants to improve his/her skills.

**Web Developer**, Hatline Romania, *April 2007 - April 2008*

php, html, css, jquery, ajax

- analyze requirements and establish solutions together with project members
- frontend development using HTML/CSS/JS
- backend development using PHP 
- used Linux(Fedora, Mandriva) as operating system during development

One of the issues we had due to the fact that most of us were young and inexperienced was related to communication and team work.

We did not use source control or project management tools. We only realized the importance of these tools once we started using them.

Lesson learned.
