How important are algorithms during your day to day job?
Why algorithms?


A while ago a came across Hired, a website which connects developers with companies.Something about it seemed different, not your regular job site, so I decided to create a profile and have a look.

Last step, some coding challenges. Seems fair, let's give it a try. 
- matching parantheses
- something related to permutations
- another problem I failed at

During my last job search, some interviews had coding challanges.
Online, collaborative editor and another person watching.(was a bit strage)

In the past years even if I have been working full time as a developer, algorithms were not part of the day to day work. Tempted to say it is because of the project but it's not one project, it's several projects.

Why are algorithms important?

It is about how you think, not a specific technology or language and algorithms do that, they force you to think, to stay focused.

Why don't I practice?

1* First thing that comes in to mind is why spend time on algorithms when I have not used them except in interviews or coding challanges.

2* Is it worth spending that time, when there are a lot of other things I can do? I am not sure if this is just lazyness or it is actually a valid point.

It is easy to say that I am wasting time but is it wasting time when it is something that helps me think and focus?

I am sure it also takes energy beside time but probably it is much better to use this time and energy on algorithms instead of Facebook/TV or other non productive activities.

Maybe non productive activities might be a bit to much, I am sure I will always need things to do for fun or just relax. 

One thing I could do is track my time, see exactly where time goes. Tracking time? this sounds like wasting time all over again... initially, and it might also be laziness/comodity again.

Maybe I only need to spare 30 - 45 min a day, which can be fit into almost any schedule.  30 minutes in the morning when you are supposed to be most relaxed and ready for work sounds like a good ideea.

3*
Algorithms? Again? These things are for beginners! I am an experienced developer, what will my Github checkins tell to people when they see Binary Search?

This might just be me caring too much about other people think. Guess it's human behaviour at work and maybe not a good reason.

4* It's hard work
I can remember from previous encounters that it's not a walk in the park. What if I start and drop it after 2 weeks.
Not sure how much interest I will have after 2 weeks.
Almost certainly some days, when something else comes up I will not be in any mood for algorithms.  Can you learn algorithms from time to time? or do you need to commit and use the 30 min daily?

5* When is it enough?
Maybe if I don't have a study plan, which I think I saw online, I will not get a feeling of accomplishment at the end.
A book might also do it.


Why not learn another thing?
At some point you need to choose between Algorithms and Technology X.
Almost certainly can not learn everything.

What do you want to do?
Algorithms, not using them but get you thinking.
Something more relevant to what you do, there are a lot of choices.




6 Helps you find issues with your workflow
Normally you get confortable with a working environment, in my case is Visual Studio with VIM plugin.
I am not sure a full featured IDE is something I want to use when writting an algoritm.
Decided to use VIM, Javascript, NPM to pull in jasmine-node for TDD and Git.
Use all before should be easy, right? Not really, What was the syntax for jasmine specs, how did I run them?

Probably normal to forget these things but it's still a bit anoying when I have to search for it again.

Important!
Why is VS not OK?
Might be another bias I have, tools. It is easy to be always tweaking your environment instead of getting something done.
