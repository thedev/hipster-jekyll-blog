I made o habit of looking into different technologies quite often and the first step is to find a couple of good learning resources.

The best resource: books + practice (required), by practice I mean writing code.

However when you are trying to get the general idea about something a book might take to long or cover more advanced topics.

So I usually check out some videos first. It is very comfortable, only takes a couple of minutes and when you know where to look you can get more than decent idea about your interests.

I use <a title="Tekpub" href="http://tekpub.com/" target="_blank">Tekpub</a>  and <a title="tutsplus" href="https://tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">Tutsplus</a>.<a title="tutsplus" href="https://tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">
</a>

Top quality resources, cover a lot of technologies, tools or methodologies.

Like all good things, you will need to pay for the majority of these productions but you also get free stuff like <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">net.tutsplus.com</a> or on tekpub you have a free section.

A lot of text for just two resources... not cool but anyway I need to get used to writing posts so ...

P.S. if you're into PHP this guy (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JREAMdesign">JREAM Design</a>) has a lot of quality content on his youtube channel.
