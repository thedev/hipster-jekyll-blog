String sanitation is a must do for all PHP programmers.

Personally I used a complex function that escaped everything that I thought would might cause problems. However this is not a very professional approach.

Recently I found a debate on a forum regarding this aspect and one guy pointed out that for every situation:
<ul>
	<li>mysql calls
<pre class="brush:php">mysql_real_escape_string()</pre>
</li>
	<li>html output
<pre class="brush:php">htmlspecialchars()</pre>
</li>
	<li>regular expressions
<pre class="brush:php">preg_quote()</pre>
</li>
	<li>use in an external command
<pre class="brush:php">escapeshellarg()/escapeshellcmd()</pre>
</li>
</ul>
a standard function should suffice.

The point is that you need to sanitize your string accordingly to your requirements. And probably in most of the cases you can use a build in function.
