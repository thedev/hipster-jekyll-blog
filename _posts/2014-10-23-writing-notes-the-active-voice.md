Use the active voice and write with strong verbs.

##Active voice:

"Subject verb object"


##The passive voice:

"Object verb" or "Object verb subject"

"Mistakes were made"

Who made the mistakes? abdicates responsibility

Passive verb has two parts. Form of to be + past participle of main verb.
The main verb must be a transitive object. It has to take an object. 

She throws the ball

vs 

She runs. (does not take an object)

She runs the comapny. (takes an object)
The company is run by her.

Passive voice example:

ex 1

My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

- starts with the object, the visit
- passive verb, will be + remember
- subject, me

 object verb subject

active voice: I will always remember my first visit to Boston.

ex 2

She is loved.

- object, she
- passive verb, is loved


ex 3

Cigarrete ads were designed to appeal especially to children.

- verb, were designed (who designed them, takes away responsibilty)

active voice: We designed .... (forces you to have a responsible party)


To turn passive voice back to active voice ask:

Who does what to whom?
