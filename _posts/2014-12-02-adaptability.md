Tom Chi gave an interesting talk during #hacksummit, here are the main ideas.

Google glass prototype was done in a day. 

##Guessing vs direct experience
Discussion based on guesses can take more time and bring less results than putting something in place to give you a real experience and let you make a decission based on it.

##Toolchain considerations 
A good toolchaing can save you a lot of time.
While thinking about this I can find lots of activities that 

##Adaptability vs efficiency
Start by trying out different approaches to find the best ones.(addapt)
Once best option is identified focus on efficiency.

##Staying in the medium
A lot of times we get fixed on the wrong thing (specification,code) and loose track of the important thing, the experince people will have when they use the product.

##Improoving the runtime - 10% better
Create a list of weekly achievements and find an experiment that can improve them by 10%.
Trying to improve more than 10% might be to difficult and lead to failure.  Smaller improvements stack up. 
Timing is importand. Doing this on Friday morning allows you to implement the easy ones right away or think about the complex ones over the weekend.
