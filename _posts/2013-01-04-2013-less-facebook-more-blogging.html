Not quite satisfied about my actual blogging habits.

As I found out from my previous attempts, blogging on a regular basis requires discipline and a strong will.

It is very easy to get caught up with different things and forget about your plans.

Hopefully this year I will manage to stay on track.

Initial goal is to write at least 2 articles every Â week and on the long run consider the quality of these posts.

For starters, just write the damn posts and then make them interesting.

We'll have to see how this works out.
