During the last few weeks the World Cup was a hot topic.
I ocassionaly placed small bets for fun and after a few lucky stikes I found myself thinking about possible outcomes often.

One thing that I noticed is that a lot of the predictions are based on my mood.
I noticed this before when after loosing a bet, in an effort to compensate I placed an unjustified bet.

Because the stakes were not high I did not pay much attention and I confortably moved on, even though I knew this was not a good way to make decissions.

Today I read and interesting chapter called Intuition vs Formula from *Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman* where he talks about human judgement vs formulas.

* Great book but a bit hard to follow, this is the main reason I decided to write this post, notes

The discussionis  complex and sensible but there are a couple of interesting ideas.

Considering my World Cup betting, an alternative to impulsive decissions would be to find a set of variables for a team, rate them 1 to 5 and use the total as an idicator.
Also thinking about the characteristics of the teams would allow you to go over information in an organized way and give you a better view.

Not saying that the algorithm predictions will be better, but the way the decission is made is better.

Simple algorithm that saved lives: **The Apgar Test** for assessing a new born using variables like heart rate, muscle tone, respiration, reflex and color.

P.S.I need to write more, a lot of room for improvement to say it nicely
