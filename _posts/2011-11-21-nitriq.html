During last week while trying to refactor legacy code I found this.

<em><strong><a title="nitriq" href="http://nitriq.com/">Nitriq Code Analysis</a></strong> is an easy-to-use, powerful tool for code reviews, understanding your code base, finding Types and Methods that should be refactored, creating custom metrics, and enforcing best practices.</em>

Very similar to nDepend whith one major advantage <strong>Nitriq Pro Developer Edition is FREE</strong>.
