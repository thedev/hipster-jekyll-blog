## Principles of effective writting

Before:

> Dysregulation of physiologic micro RNA, MIR.
> Activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis.
> Therefore, molecular species that can regulate MIR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant, mature MIRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer.

After:

> Changes in micro RNA expression play a role in cancer including Glioma.
> Therefore, events that disrupt micro RNAs from binding to their target RNAs may also promote cancer.



### Specific features that make the first sentence hard to read:

- nouns instead of verbs: Dysregulation, initiation, progression
- vague words: physiologic, molecular species
- jargon and acronyms: gliomagenesis(formation of glioma), miR, miRs
- passive voice: 'has been shown'

active voice: She throws the ball

passive voice: The ball was thrown by her

- to much distance between the subject and verb.

### What to do

Cut unecessary words and phrases.

Use active voice.

Writting with strong verbs and keep subject and main verbs together at the beginning of the sentence.
