After a long time I finally managed to spare some time and install WP.

My last two blog attempts failed, probably because of many reasonsÂ  ... to many to count.

This blog is up due to a inspirational presentation by Scott Hanselman : <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/glucose/hanselminutes-on-9-social-networking-for-developers-part-1-every-developer-needs-a-blog" target="_blank">"Every Developer Needs a Blog" </a> ... It makes sense

Thanks <a href="http://mcanti.wordpress.com/">mcanti</a> for the tip
