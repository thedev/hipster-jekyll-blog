Writting in the sciences

What makes good writing?
- communicate clearly and effectively an ideea
- elegant an stylish, people tend to focus on this instead of clear and efective. This happens later, after reviews.

Requirements:
Clear thinking and something to say

What to do:
First thing, figure out what you want to say.
Simple learnable rules of style.
Reading professional good writing is really helpfull. Pay attention to how professional writers write. 
A few minutes practicing daily.
Drop bad "accademic" habbits 
Talking about an ideaa before writing helps because it makes it more clear.
Don't bore the reader.
Stop waiting for inspiration. Not needed to write.

Considerations:
Hard for everyone, knowing this can help reduce the anxiety.
Revision, nobody gets it perfect on the first try. Elegance happens during revision.
Cut ruthlessy, dont become attached to your own words.
Start taking risks in writting, put something a bit funny, provocative.
