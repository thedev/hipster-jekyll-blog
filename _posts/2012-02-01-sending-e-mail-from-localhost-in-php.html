If you don't have access to a SMTP server this is what you need:

<a href="http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/">http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/</a>

<em>Windows 7/Vista/XP/2003/2010 compatible dummy SMTP server. Sits in the system tray and does not deliver the received messages. The received messages can be quickly viewed, saved and the source/structure inspected. Useful for testing/debugging software that generates email.</em>

If you do have access to a SMTP server all you need to do is update the servername  and smtp_port  in your php.ini file:
<pre class="brush:php">SMTP = smtp.myserver.com
smtp_port = 25</pre>
<p class="brush:php">For details on php mailing functions check out the manual.</p>
